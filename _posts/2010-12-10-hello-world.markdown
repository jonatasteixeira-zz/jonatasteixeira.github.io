Hello World, I am Jonatas,

I'm a Brazilian lover of coding. I have been living in São Paulo since 2012 and I moved here get my masters in computer science. Before living in São Paulo I lived in Curitiba, my hometown, which for me, is the best place to live in Brazil. There is also where I finished my graduation in computer science.

My professionals experiences are few. My first job was in the Federal University of Parana, place where I graduated, I worked with a team of researches and developers called Center for Scientific Computer and Free Software , we create some educational software in Java for Web, Condigital Project. My second job was in Mandriva Conectiva Linux, a flavor of Linux. In Mandriva I starred in a lot of projects, but the most important were: OpenClass, now called Mandriva Class, and OEM. In this last I acquired many skills in Linux, such as coding drivers and low level programming. After Mandriva I move to São Paulo where I started to work for Itau as a System Analyst, the largest bank of Latin America. 

From now my interest are DevOps, Continuous Egineering, Mobile, Dev and Linux.
